<h2>Project 1: Feature Engineering</h2>
<p>This project is from my participation in Simplilearn's CalTech Data Science Bootcamp during the <i>Applied Python for Data Science</i> course.   The project is primarily based on feature engineering using the dataset on <b>housing prices in Ames, Iowa</b>. Successful completion of this project rated the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>basics of Python</li>
<li>application of Python libraries in data science</li>
<li>skewness</li>
<li>perform analysis on a dataset</li>
<li>knowledge of DataFrame</li>
</ul>
